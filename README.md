# fix-vocabulary

This project is a controlled vocabulary of business terms used in FIX Protocol. This a project of [FIX Trading Community](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/).

The vocabulary is intended to serve multiple purposes:

* A machine readable file for editing the vocabulary in the future, as opposed to text files.
* Humanly readable documentation can be generated in various forms.
* A semantic file can be queried in a SPARQL endpoint.
* Vocabulary terms can be linked to other financial industry vocabularies.
* Provides stable semantic concepts to inform message translators between different versions of FIX or between FIX and other protocols.

## Semantic notations

The vocabulary is encoding using semantic notations:

[Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/)

[Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/)

Some metadata is noted with [Dublin Core Terms](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)

The file is serialized using [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) notation.

These notations may be read and edited using tools like [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).

## Presentation

For easy viewing of the semantic file, it is wrapped in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

The [Gastrodon](https://github.com/paulhoule/gastrodon) toolkit enables the notebook to handle RDF data.

## Initial implementation

The initial vocabulary file was created by mechanical translation of FIX Glossary in FIX Protocol Version 5.0 Service Pack 2 Volume 1 with Errata 20110818.

## Notation guideline

Each vocabulary term is encoded as a SKOS Concept in the following format.
We also use some notations from Dublin Core Terms, prefixed here as "dct".

| Source       | Predicate      | Object       |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| skos:Concept | skos:prefLabel | (name)       |
|              | skos:altLabel  | (synonym)    |
|              | skos:definition| (description |
|              | dct:isPartOf   | (spec name)  |
|              | dct:source     | (reference)  |

Example:

```
:AveragePriceOption rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual ,
                             rdf:type ,
                             skos:Concept ;
                    dct:isPartOf "EP92" ;
                    skos:altLabel "Asian Option" ;
                    skos:definition "The underlying price is an average of the daily settlement prices over a specified  period" ;
                    skos:prefLabel "Average Price Option" .
```
